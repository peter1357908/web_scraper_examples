## install the required libraries:
```
pip install beatifulsoup4
pip install selenium
```

## download the ChromeDriver
Download the appropriate version [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and place the executable `chromedriver.exe` in the same directory as the `get_soup.py` script.

ChromeDriver, invoked by Selenium, essentially makes content dynamically generated by JS scrape-able (by executing JavaScript as if visiting the target URL in Chrome).
